Our website can be accessed by: https://mdd-g8.onrender.com/

Our website is coded out using the programming languages HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and Javascript from scratch. 
Alongside the programming languages, Bootstrap stylesheet for CSS, jQuery, Popper.js, Bootstrap’s JavaScript and Plotly Javascript library is used for aid in adding functionalities and formatting. In this section, screenshots of the website will be provided in each sub-section.

Our website is both functional on any device, being responsive and usable on PCs, laptops and mobile phones. On the mobile version, the navigation bar has to be tapped on the top right in order to expand it, while on the PC version, the navigation bar is on the top of the screen.
